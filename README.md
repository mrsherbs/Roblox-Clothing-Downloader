# Roblox-Clothing-Tools
Automation tools for Roblox clothing assets

# Features
* Automatically download clothing assets from Roblox
* Remove clothing template backgrounds and add custom logos to them
* Upload downloaded assets to Roblox (WIP, not complete)

# Usage
Change settings in the config.ini file, then run the clothing-downloader program.
Optionally, move the downloaded templates to the designated background replacer directory. 
Then, run the background-remover program to replace the template backgrounds.
The background replacer will take a template image and replace the original posters background, to erase any watermarks.
